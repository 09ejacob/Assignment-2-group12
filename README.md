To run the code, you simply run the Main.java file.

By using synchronized threads we observed that the results/output was sorted/synchronized. This ensures that only one thread can access the booking method at a time, preventing inconsistensies and overbooking. This also gave more clear view of what was happening and also made it more readabe.

To make the threads synchronized, we added "synchronized" to the bookTicket method. This makes it so that multiple thread can not access method at the same time. The synchronization prevents overbooking of tickets and resolves inconsistencies.
